# Curriculum Infrastructure
### Overview
The repositories found in this organization contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) research project developed by [Jonathan Chua](https://www.github.com/chizuo) under the guidance of [Dr. Xunfei Jiang](https://www.csun.edu/~xjiang/index.html) for the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.csun.edu/engineering-computer-science/computer-science) at [California State University, Northridge](https://www.csun.edu/). The project is centered around the MDF data center and focuses on enhancing operational efficiency through automation.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to streamline and automate critical aspects of data center management, including:
- **Maintenance Operations:** Automating routine maintenance tasks to ensure high availability and reliability of the infrastructure.
- **Virtual Machine Deployment:** Simplifying and expediting the process of virtual machine deployment to enable rapid scaling and provisioning.
- **Virtual Machine Scheduling:** Implementing intelligent scheduling algorithms to optimize resource utilization and performance across virtual machines.

### Infrastructure
The automation orchestrates tasks across two of the six clusters managed by the Department of Computer Science's Curriculum Infrastructure project. These two clusters comprise a total of 20 HP ProLiant BL460c Gen9 host systems.

### Impact
By leveraging the principles of IaC, this project aims to establish a robust experimental platform that supports the ongoing active research initiatives led by Dr. Xunfei Jiang. The anticipated outcome is a more agile, responsive, and cost-effective data center environment, setting a precedent for future research and development in the field.
